> - How to write and start a simple `Hello world!` application


## Install Rust

At first, you need to install Rust, you can reference the [official documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).


## Create a new Ribir project

Then, open your terminal and create a new Rust project:

```sh
cargo new ribir-hello-world
cd ribir-hello-world
```

Next, edit the `Cargo.toml` file and add Ribir as a dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
ribir = "0.4.0-alpha.39"
```

Or you can directly run `cargo add --git "https://github.com/RibirX/Ribir" ribir` to let Cargo add the latest Ribir version that is under development for you.

## Start writing `main.rs`

Open your editor and modify the `src/main.rs` file to:

```rust no_run
// main.rs
use ribir::prelude::*;

fn main() {
  App::run(text! { text: "Hello World!" });
}
```

## Run the application

```sh
cargo run
```

Congratulations! You have completed your first Ribir project.

## Run Ribir's built-in examples

Finally, there are some other examples in the Ribir repository, you can clone the Git repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:RibirX/Ribir.git
cd Ribir/Ribir
```

and run the examples with one of the following commands:

```sh
cargo run -p counter
cargo run -p storybook
cargo run -p messages
cargo run -p todos
cargo run -p wordle_game
```

## Next Steps

If you're hesitant about creating UI with "DSL" and prefer to build your UI through direct function calls, before moving on to the next step, you might want to read [Using Ribir without "DSL"](../understanding_ribir/without_dsl.md) first.
